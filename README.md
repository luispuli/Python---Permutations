# Python---

Excited to share a recent project where we explored permutations and combinations in Python, focusing on color arrangements and groupings 🎨. By applying an analytical framework based on factorials and combinatorics 🔢, and coding from scratch a few lines in Python 🐍, we reached the same results while effectively depicting constraints and filtering results.
